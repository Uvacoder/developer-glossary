JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.

JavaScript Object Notation is an open standard file format, and data interchange format, that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and array data types.

Since the JSON format is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format by any programming language (i.e. JSON is language independent). JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand.
