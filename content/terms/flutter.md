Flutter is a UI software development kit that is used for developing iOS, Android, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and web applications. It is based on Dart programming language.

It provides fast development (with its Stateful Hot Reload feature) and beautiful Material Design and Cupertino widgets which incorporate critical platform differences between Android and iOS.

## Example
