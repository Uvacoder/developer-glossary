Agile Software Development, or Agile for short, is one of many popular software development methodologies in practice today. Agile encourages flexible planning, early delivery, and continual development within a team and product. Agile is an encompassing term that includes other methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban which also promote Agile values.

Key to Agile Software Development is the _Agile Manifesto_. This manifesto, crafted by seventeen software developers in 2001, outline Agile values and principles, as shown below:

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
>
> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
> **Responding to change** over following a plan
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

Agile Software Development is directly opposed to traditional _Waterfall_ development. Whereas Agile is run incrementally and iteratively, Waterfall is sequential in its approach: Requirements are first gathered, then a design is formed, development occurs, then shipping the application. At no point is a step revisted, even if a client is unhappy with the final product. For teams that use an Agile framework, a step is iterated on at any point during the development process, ensuring the client has feeback and recieves value.

## Example

> My team uses Agile Software Development to quickly iterate on our product, providing quick and meaningful value to our customer.
