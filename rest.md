REST (Representational state transfer) is architectural style used for creating distributed hypermedia systems (Web services). It defines following constraints which must be satisfied if an interface needs to be referred as RESTful. 

> 1. Clientâ€“server 
> 2. Stateless 
> 3. Cacheable 
> 4. Uniform interface
> 5. Layered system
> 6. Code on demand (optional) 

RESTful Web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations, in the form of an HTTP method, or verb (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.). By using a stateless protocol and standard operations, RESTful systems aim for fast performance, reliability, and the ability to grow by reusing components.

Note -  REST is an architectural style. There is no "official" standard for RESTful web APIs, REST is not a standard in itself, but RESTful implementations make use of standards, such as HTTP, URI, JSON, and XML.


## Example

> REST is a way to access resources which lie in a particular environment. For example, you could have a server that could be hosting important documents or pictures or videos.
