Wiki is a hypertext publication collaboratively edited and managed by its own audience directly using a web browser. A typical wiki contains multiple pages for the subjects or scope of the project and may be either open to the public or limited to use within an organization for maintaining its internal knowledge base. 

## Example

 "Take some more [[tea]]," the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.
 
 "I've had '''nothing''' yet," Alice replied in an offended tone, "so I can't take more."
 
 "You mean you can't take ''less''," said the Hatter. "It's very easy to take ''more'' than nothing."
