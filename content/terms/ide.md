An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) allows developers to execute a number of tasks related to creating a computer program within one environment. A text editor, terminal, debugging tools, and code snippets are tools that may be included in an IDE.

## Example

I am using Visual Studio Code as my IDE of choice because of its ease-of-use, code snippets, and customization options.
